Example usage:

1. import recaptcha

2. get the html of the page you think might be using ReCaptcha.

3. do: recaptcha.checkForReCaptcha(html)
   the result will return False or True. 

4. if the result is True, now do:
   recaptcha.getCaptcha(html)

5. This will return the captcha image url. Load this in XBMC and ask
   for the user's response.

6. Now do: 
   params = recaptcha.buildResponse(userresponse)
   This will return some parameters.

7. Now you can load the response by when building your url opener
   by adding in:
   req = urllib2.Request(url, params)

8. On the html of the result, you should now run
   recaptcha.checkIfSuceeded(html) 
   again. If the response is True then the user has entered the right captcha.
   If the response is False, you should restart the whole process over again.
